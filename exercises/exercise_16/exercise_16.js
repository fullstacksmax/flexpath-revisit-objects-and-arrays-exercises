/* 
Exercise 16: Advanced Use of Object.create and Prototypes

Problem:

Create a function `createUser` that returns an object with a 
'name' property and a method `sayHello`. 

Use Object.create to set the prototype of the returned object to a 
shared prototype object. 

Demonstrate that multiple users share the same prototype. */
